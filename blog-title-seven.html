					<h5>How I stay committed to learning</h5>
					<p>
						I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to
						create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my
						journey with the world.
					</p>

					<h5>How I got started</h5>
					<p>
						I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
						After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
						summaries of what I learned using my own words.
					</p>
					<p>
						That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
						others learn and stay motivated.
